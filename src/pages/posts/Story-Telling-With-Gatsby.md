## User Stories

Like any technological effort, I start with the simplest user story.

```gherkin
As a developer,
I want a blog,
So that I can share my technological learnings
```

After engineering my user story, I had to research and outsource a lot of my design and experience practices to identify the best and most efficient way to go about this.

### Stack

#### Linode

Since I love my [Linode](http://linode.com) dashboard and support staff, I decided to make this apart of my stack. I wanted to deploy to a production instance in a Linux environment, managed by Linode.

```gherkin
As a developer,
I want a Linode Linux instance,
So I can deploy my blog to a production instance.
